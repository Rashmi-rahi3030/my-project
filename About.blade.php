        <h5>Almost all of our packaging is recyclable or made from recycled materials. With the aim of being 100%<br>

            recyclable in the near future.<br><br>
            
            To avoid over production, we always release new products in small batches and if you guys love it and<br>
            
            want more…we’ll make more. This is done with our smart-savvy forecasting data and of course, you! Our<br>
            
            CS and social team are always passing on your feedback straight back to the design team which helps us<br>
            
            tweak products and plan for future production. When it comes to releasing new products, we don’t<br>
            
            adhere to typical seasonal launches as we believe that any we design and create will stand the test of<br>
            
            time, not the season. Because of this we try to release little and often, this helps us learn as we go and<br>
            
            test new designs constantly!</h5>
